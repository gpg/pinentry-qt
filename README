PIN Entry for QT
----------------

This is a stand alone version of the qt4 pinentry from the pinentry package.
It does not use a secure line edit widget though, thereby decreasing security
a bit but increasing compatibility with customized environments like found
on mobile devices.  It also builds with cmake instead of autotools.  It does
not feature a curses fallback either.

Some of the code is taken from Robert Bihlmeyer's Quintuple-Agent.
For security reasons, all internationalization has been removed.  The
client is expected to tell the PIN entry the text strings to be
displayed.
